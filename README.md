**Problems or bugs**
  * The chart is still rather ugly and not nice enough, might consider to remove top labels especially.
  * The app can be force closed by closing the app through back button, but the count down will continue regardless.
  * The apps in white list is not sorted alphabetically and have no method to search a specific app.
  * Can't set your own ringtone.
  * Takes a bit time to load for apps on starting screen.
  * Checks for the current app in foreground every 5s, not that efficient.
  * There'll be a problem for the bar chart if the user does not use the app consecutively, in which it will disrupt the real date.
  
**Future plan**
  * Overcome the problems especially the force close app.
  * Makes the app smoother by reducing the loading time.
  * Add in more artistic means.
  * Enable customisable ringtone.
  * Adding strict and relaxed mode.
